Someone is going to have to walk me through this parser thing and the camera. Because otherwise it's going to be wonky


arrows- move camera/object
g- toggle grid
t- snap to grid
q- scale up
w- scale down
a- rotate clockwise
d- rotate counterclockwise
i- change id
Enter- place/grab
Tab- cycle through assets
shfit tab- cycle backwards

How do I know if the crosshair is over occupied space?


- Pickup objects
- translate crosshair coordinates to global
- Editing
- Grid snap
- Fixing the camera
- Saving to JSOn
- How to stock the objects 

local to global- put in object's local coordinate, multiplying it by every single parent it has. 

global to local is the opposite

check if you're clicking on something- get position of coursor, loop over all objects, get the bounding box, check if in bounds, 

Switch to new camera

Clone object method-
global to local method-
local to global method-


displayobjet with all the placeable stuff as children, clone child and give it to crosshair.
Boundary around level.
