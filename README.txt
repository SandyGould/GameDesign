UI COMPONENTS ASSIGNMENT - A Guide to Our Game

After running the Makefile, run the command `bin/myGame sfx_demo` to run our game.

A textbook will appear when the game first opens. Press any key to clear it. The health bar in the top left corner will deplete when
the player is within a certain area on the map. Move away before you die! 

Lastly, press the escape key to open the menu.

Thanks for being our TA and grading our game!!!
