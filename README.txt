Controller is working (but not much is actually mapped in the demo).

Joystick: Move

All buttons are xbox mapping -- other controllers will be whatever button is in
the equivalent position.

A: Bigger
B: Smaller

The game ignores keyboard input while there is controller input.


Animated sprites didn't get finished in time and were on a different branch
which doesn't have controller support, so this branch doesn't have any
spritesheet functionality. Our team is planning to finish both the spritesheets
and the devtool over break. This week was mostly focused on the devtool for us,
which is why spritesheets aren't done (devtool has made a lot of progress).
