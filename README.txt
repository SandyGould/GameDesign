So unfortunately we haven't been able to fully implement the Collision System or get the demo running. However, we've made substantial progress on hitboxes and figuring out if there are collisions between them (including all of those annoying repeated equations). We have yet to work on the overarching detection structure (as in, the part that actually listens for collisions between particular objects and stuff) and collision resolution. Our work can be found in the DisplayObject and CollisionSystem .cpp and .h files.
