TODO:

URGENT:

Lower Priority:
- Fix control clicking in assets window crash
- Make displayobject IDs unique?
- Set parent feature -- make children not move upon using
- Edit scene tab
- Align with grid button
- Clean up displayobject, sprite, and animatedsprite implementation
  (make constructors and methods cleaner)
  - Thoughts on DisplayObjects
    - I don't think the surface needs to be stored. From every code example
      I see, they make the surface, then the texture, then free the surface
      I feel like we should make this change if we want to keep the game crisp
    - The overall creation and methods of DisplayObjects could be revamped a bit
      It might just be because we were not expected to use multiple windows, but
      it feels like trying to do anything special requires a bunch of weird
      workarounds
