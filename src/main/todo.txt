TODO:

- FIX CONTROL CLICKING IN ASSETS WINDOW???
- Create assets menu
  - Figure out text display
*- Load in sprites and animated sprites correctly

- Make displayobject IDs unique?

*- Set parent feature
*- Save correctly
- Edit scene tab
- Align with grid button

- Fix box drawing on whatever window is currently active. 
(Temp fixed: consider adding renderer field to display objects though).

- Thoughts on DisplayObjects
  - I don't think the surface needs to be stored. From every code example
    I see, they make the surface, then the texture, then free the surface
    I feel like we should make this change if we want to keep the game crisp
  - The overall creation and methods of DisplayObjects could be revamped a bit
    It might just be because we were not expected to use multiple windows, but
    it feels like trying to do anything special requires a bunch of weird
    workarounds
